Kyra Developer Task

At Kyra, we make content that regularly sits on 3 platforms - YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. We pull data regularly (between 1/minute to 1/day) from the various APIs that these platforms offer. This data is then stored, and in some way transformed to allow members of the team to better understand it.

For this task, you will be carrying out a similar extract/transform set of steps. The aim of this task is to understand:
Your developer ability
The way you approach new problems and platforms

Please submit your task either as a Github repository, or zipped with necessary instructions to run. You can use any language you want, as well as 3rd party libraries, if they help.

The Task
1. Set up a Google APIs account
2. Set up an application using the YouTube Data API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
3. Use the API to pull a list of all videos uploaded to the PAQ channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvO6uJUVJQ6SrATfsWR5_aA)
4. Display a list of the videos, including thumbnails, on a page. The page should render the items in a way that works on both mobile and desktop browsers.
5. Make sure that this list is kept up to date regularly - either by having a task that refreshes backend data, or by pulling in data live into the application
6. Stretch Task:
Display a graph, showing how many videos were uploaded per week, over the last 18 months. A graphing library such as Google Charts or Highcharts is typically useful for this step.
