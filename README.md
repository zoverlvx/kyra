## The Task
- Set up a Google APIs account
- Set up an application using the YouTube Data API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
- Use the API to pull a list of all videos uploaded to the PAQ channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvO6uJUVJQ6SrATfsWR5_aA)
- Display a list of the videos, including thumbnails, on a page. The page should render the items in a way that works on both mobile and desktop browsers.
- Make sure that this list is kept up to date regularly - either by having a task that refreshes backend data, or by pulling in data live into the application
- Stretch Task
- Display a graph, showing how many videos were uploaded per week, over the last 18 months. A graphing library such as Google Charts or Highcharts is typically useful for this step.
